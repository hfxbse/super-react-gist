# [super-react-gist](https://github.com/GeorgeGkas/super-react-gist)

Simple and flexible component that allows you to embed [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) in
[React](https://reactjs.org) projects.
This demo illustrates a basic usage of **super-react-app** component.

## Render one file
With **super-react-app** you are able to render a single file from a gist repository.

<Canvas of={GistStories.SingleFile}/>

## Render multiple files
You are not restricted to using only one **super-react-app** component in your project.

<Canvas of={GistStories.MultipleFiles}/>

## Render using `file` prop

Works both on **public** and **secret** gists.
Oh snap! *face-palm*!
In case you didn't notice we can only use the above method to render files that do not contain any uppercase letter.
For instance, if our Gist repo contains a file `CaMelCase.js`, then providing just the permalink will not work!

**Q**: How can we render this `CaMelCase.js` file?

**A**: By providing a `file` prop to our `Gist` component to indicate which file we want to include.

This is how we do it:

<Canvas of={GistStories.CamelCaseFileName}/>

## Render the whole Gist

Of course, we can also embed the whole Gist repository just by copying the Gist URL.

<Canvas of={GistStories.WholeGist}/>

## Error Component

Render a custom error component if Gist could not be retrieved.

<Canvas of={GistStories.CustomErrorComponent}/>

## Color mode

If you are working at night, you might want to switch to dark mode. Light attracts bugs anyway.

<Canvas of={GistStories.ColorModeDark}/>

In case you want it to follow your operating system preference, use the color mode `auto`.

<Canvas of={GistStories.ColorModeAuto}/>

## Combine all the above techniques

*This example is left as an exercise to the reader.*
