## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= v18 must be installed.

## Installation

- Running `npm install` in the app's root directory will install everything you need for development.

## Development Server

- `npm start` will run the app's [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot module 
  reloading.

## Building

- `npm run build` creates a production build by default.

   To create a development build, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `development` while running this command.
